Code submission for NBA Hackathon 2018 event

## How To Run The Program
In order to run the program, go to the base directory of nba_hackathon. Then on the command line use the following commands:

```bash
#only for the first time do the following command
chmod a+x plus_minus.py

python ./plus_minus.py
```

After these commands are executed, the result should be in a .csv file in the results folder of your directory, overwriting what was previously there and is on the github.
